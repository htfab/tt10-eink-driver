NOTES on e-ink driver Tiny Tapeout project
Written by Tim Edwards
March 16, 2025

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This project is an e-ink display driver.  It is intended to work
with the Adafruit ThinkInk 2.13" monochrome e-ink display board
with SRAM.

Both the e-ink display and the on-board SRAM (and also the on-board
SD card, although that is not used in this project) have SPI
interfaces with individual select controls.

The board has a 14-pin connector with power and ground, shared
SPI control and data lines, and individual SPI select lines for
the three interfaces.

The project expects that these pins are wired into the input/output
PMOD on Tiny Tapeout.  The pin connections are as follows
(directions are from the perspective of the e-ink display and
board):

e-ink display board pin description		use/direction
------------------------------------------------------------
VIN:	3.3V in					power
3V3:	regulated out (unused)			output
GND	ground					ground
SCK	shared SPI clock			input
MISO	SPI in (from SRAM only)			output
MOSI	SPI out (to SRAM or e-ink display)	input
ECS	e-ink select				input
D/C	e-ink data or command select		input
SRCS	SRAM select				input
SDCS	SD card select (unused)			input
RST	e-ink reset				input
BUSY	e-ink busy (status read-back)		output
ENA	ena = !(power down)

Note: If ENA is pulled low, then the board goes into minimum
power state, but the SRAM powers down and SRAM data is lost.
ENA has an internal pull-up, so it can be left unconnected
and the board will stay enabled.

Also note:  BUSY can be ignored if the driver is completely
self-timed, but eith SDCS and ENA not being used, there are
sufficient pins on one PMOD to connect and use this.

e-ink display board pin connections to input/output PMOD
See "Tech specs --> Pinouts" in the Tiny Tapeout web pages.
See the "SPI" section.  Using the suggested SPI connections
for the top row, and filling out the bottom row with the
rest of the signals.  Directions in the following table
are from the perspective of the Tiny Tapeout board and
chip.

pin	signal	direction  PMOD pin
----------------------------------------------------------
ECS:	uio[0]	output	   1
MOSI:	uio[1]	output	   2
MISO:	uio[2]	input	   3
SCK:	uio[3]	output	   4
SRCS:	uio[4]	output	   7
RST:	uio[5]	output	   8
BUSY:	uio[6]	input	   9
D/C:	uio[7]	output	   10
GND:			   11 or 5
VIN:			   12 or 6
----------------------------------------------------------

To be clearer, these are the PMOD pins looking into the
connector socket on the Tiny Tapeout board:

	6  5  4  3  2  1
	12 11 10 9  8  7

SPI Protocols:

These are the routines implemented in the Adafruit driver that
need to be implemented in the verilog SPI master.  The board
setup is very simple;  there is an SRAM chip with an SPI
interface, and an eInk display with an SPI interface.  These
do not connect to each other (that I am aware of).  Therefore,
the SRAM is simply storage, and generating the display from
SRAM requires using both SPI interfaces to read each pixel
value from SRAM and apply it to the display.

The e-ink display is a complicated piece of hardware, and it
is controlled by the SSD1680 chip (see
https://www.crystalfontz.com/controllers/datasheet-viewer.php?id=497)
The SSD1680 is what implements the e-ink display's SPI controller.
It supports tri-color displays, so the red color buffer may have
to be set (?).  It has its own RAM for up to 176 x 296 resolution
(so is this rotated with respect to the display board?).  RAM is
176 x 296 x 2 because there is a black/white buffer and a red buffer.
The D/C pin is optional, and there is a 3-pin interface that does
not need it, but apparently the Adafruit board is configured for
the 4-pin operation.  CS is active low.

Protocols are not show in any datasheet that I know of, and
are instead inferred from the Adafruit source code for the
SSD1680 driver, found at:

-----------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Adafruit_EPD/src/drivers/Adafruit_SSD1680.cpp
-----------------------------------------------------------

busy_wait():
	Read "busy" pin and wait for it to go low.  Polls
	every 10ms

begin():
	Run EPD begin()
	Set black buffer (red buffer is assumed to do nothing
	with the monochrome display)
	powerDown()

update(): 
	Send SPI comand DISP_CTRL2=0x22 with value 0xF4.
	Send SPI command MASTER_ACTIVATE=0x20 (no value)
	busy_wait()

powerUp():
	hardwareReset()
	delay(100)	(100ms)
	busy_wait()

	Run init code:
		SW_RESET=0x12
		(busy_wait())
		DATA_MODE=0x11 0x03
		WRITE_BORDER=0x3c 0x05
		WRITE_VCOM=0x2c   0x36
		GATE_VOLTAGE=0x03 0x17
		SOURCE_VOLTAGE=0x04 0x41 0x00 0x32
		SET_RAMXCOUNT=0x4e 0x00
		SET_RAMYCOUNT=0x4f 0x00 0x00

	SET_RAMXPOS 0x00 0x0f			(0x0f = 15 = HEIGHT / 8 - 1)
	SET_RAMYPOS 0x00 0x00 0xf9 0x00		(0xf9 = 249 = WIDTH - 1)
	DRIVER_CONTROL 0xf9 0x00 0x00

	(The display driver chip doesn't actually know what
	 kind of display it's attached to, so this power-up
	 sequence, which is required any time the display is
	 powered up, tells the chip what the display size is
	 and what voltages to apply.)

powerDown():
	DEEP_SLEEP 0x01
	delay(100)	(100ms)

	(I'm not sure what is the point of sending a "DEEP_SLEEP"
	 command if the reset pin

writeRAMCommand(index):

setRAMAddress(x, y):
	SET_RAMXCOUNT 0x00
	SET_RAMYCOUNT 0x00 0x00

-----------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Adafruit_EPD.cpp is the higher-level set of routines.
It calls low-level routines like update() which are specific
to each display driver.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Note: "use_sram" implies using the on-board SRAM.  If not
	enabled, then memory is allocated by the driver
	program, which is not what we want, since we want
	all memory to be external.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Note:  This board was bought recently and therefore (?) uses
	the ThinkInk_213_Mono_GDEY0213B74 display initializer
	(see ThinkInk_213_Mono_GDEY0213B74.h)
	Note that _xram_offset is zero.
	Width = 250 (pixels)
	Height = 122 (pixels)

Initialization:  SPI uses mode 0, MSB first, 4MHz frequency
	(For 4MHz frequency, set Tiny Tapeout clock to 4MHz.
	 For FPGA, divide 100MHz clock by 25).

begin():
	setBlackBuffer()
	SRAM write8 K640_SEQUENTIAL_MODE MCPSRAM_WRSR
	set CS high (select e-ink display SPI)
	hardwareReset()

hardwareReset():
	Note: This appears to be an active-low reset
	set RST high
	delay(10)	(10ms)
	set RST low
	delay(10)	(10ms)
	set RST high
	delay(10)	(10ms)

drawPixel(x, y, color):		Assume "color" is 0 or 1?
	compute addr from x and y
	read value from SRAM
	Not sure this is needed---this just writes to an SRAM address.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the main routine that copies data out of SRAM memory and into the
display memory.  This is a rather tricky routine.  It requires a 1-byte
buffer.  It enables both the SRAM and display chip selects at the same
time.  It starts an SRAM block read from a specific address, then
applies the WRITE_RAM1 (or WRITE_RAM2, not used here---therefore "location"
is always zero).  The first byte of memory gets returned on the same
clocks while the writeRAM command it being issued.  So read those bytes
back into the buffer, then set D/C to data, and start writing bytes
back to the SPI as they are read out of the SPI, one byte delayed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

writeSRAMFramebufferToEPD(addr, size, location, invert):
	set SRAM CS low (active low)
	MCPSRAM_READ addr_high addr_low
	c = writeRAMCommand(location)
	c = SPItransfer(c)
	set D/C high (data)
	set CS high
	set SRAM CS high
	
display(sleep):			Sleep is true/false
	powerUp();
	setRAMAddress(0, 0);
	writeSRAMFramebufferToEPD(addr, size, 0)  (or use writeRAM...()?)
	update();
	if (sleep) powerDown();

clearDisplay():
	clearBuffer();
	display()		Display twice---removes ghost images
	delay(100)
	display()

EPD_commandList():		Send a sequence of commands.  Special values
				in the sequence are 0xFF to wait (argument is
				wait time in ms) and 0xFE to end sequence

EPD_command():			Send an SPI command to the display.
EPD_data();			Send SPI data to the display.
				Note that most display commands are in the
				form (command data data ...), that is, one byte
				command followed by N bytes data, terminated by
				raising CS.

SRAM driver:
------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Adafruit_EPD/src/drivers/Adafruit_MCPSRAM.cpp
------------------------------------------------------------------
See the Microchip datasheet for details, but this is a straightforward
SPI SRAM with the following command codes:
	Read = 0x03  addrH addrL
	Write = 0x02  addrH addrL
	Read status register = 0x05
	Write status register = 0x01
	Sequential mode = 0x40

"Sequential mode" value needs to be written into the status register
to enable stream read/write mode where values are output continuously
while incrementing the address until the chip select is raised.

Read and Write are followed by the 16-bit address (msb/MSB first) and
followed by data.
Read status register and write status register are followed immediately
by one byte data.
For the purposes of this demostration, "sequential mode" is written to
the status register, then all reads and writes are performed sequentially.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
General outline of the e-ink driver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make this feasible on a Tiny Tapeout slot, the 250 x 122 display will
be reduced to 34 x 17 by aggregating over blocks of 7 x 7 pixels, and
leaving a border of 6 pixels left and right, one pixel on the top, and
two pixels on the bottom.  The memory size, however, is still 578 bits,
so Tiny Tapeout applications will need to do some clever things like
run-length and delta encoding.  However, it can store the active display
in SRAM for as long as the SRAM is powered up.  The SRAM is a Microchip
23K640 64kbit SPI device, 8192 x 8 = 65536 bits.  The display is 250 x 122
= 30500, so there are 35036 unused bits, or a bit over 4kB, for additional
space.  The allocation will be address 0 = the e-ink display framebuffer,
and rounding up to 256 x 128, takes up half the SRAM, and the other half
of the SRAM starting at address 4096 can be used for general-purpose
application memory.

For the purposes of this test repository, the display is a pattern
generated algorithmically so that it does not need 578 bits of storage
(could also add an SPI slave interface and take data from a host
computer).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The TinyTapeout project implements an SPI master which controls the
pins (pinout at top of this writeup) assigned to the project.  Both
the SRAM (8kB) and display use the same SPI, with different select
pins (see pinout).  Steps 4 through 11 are per the "general operational
flow" in the SSD1680 datasheet and are not quite the same as the Adafruit
driver sequence commands.

Step 1:  Power on and reset
Step 2:  Write sequential mode to SRAM status register
Step 3:  Apply application code and write the display pixels to SRAM.
Step 4:  Do display HW reset (pulse reset pin low 10ms)
Step 5:  Do display SW reset (command 0x12), wait 10ms
Step 6:  Initialize (Commands 0x01, 0x11, 0x44, 0x45, 0x3c)
Step 7:  Load waveform LUT (Commands 0x18, 0x22, 0x20), wait on busy
Step 8:  Transfer image (Commands 0x4e, 0x4f, 0x24, 0x26)
Step 9:  Soft start (Command 0x0c)
Step 10: Drive display (Commands 0x22, 0x20), wait on busy
Step 11: Deep sleep (Command 0x10)

Wait for switch input to select display, perhaps, and repeat from
Step 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The same steps above, with SPI details:
Steps 4 through 11 correspond to the "Adafruit_EPD::display()" routine.
Steps 4 through 8 correspond to the "powerUp()" routine

Step 2:  Write sequential mode to SRAM status register
		(SRAM_CS) command = 0x01 data = 0x40
Step 3:  Apply application code and write the display pixels to SRAM.
		(SRAM_CS) command = 0x02 addr = 0x00 0x00 data = ...

Step 4:  Do display HW reset (pulse reset pin low 10ms)
	 This brings the display out of deep sleep mode
		(RST)
Step 5:  Do display SW reset (command 0x12)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x12, no data
		wait for busy signal to go low
	 	wait 10ms
Step 6:  Initialize (Suggested: Commands 0x01, 0x11, 0x44, 0x45, 0x3c)
			(DRIVER_CONTROL, DATA_MODE, RAMXPOS, RAMYPOS, BORDER)

		(Actual, in driver:)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x11 data = 0x03  (RAM data entry mode)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x3c data = 0x05  (border color)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x2c data = 0x36  (write Vcom)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x03 data = 0x17  (gate voltage)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x04 data = 0x41 0x00 0x32 (source voltage)

Step 7:  Load waveform LUT (Suggested: Commands 0x18, 0x22, 0x20), wait on busy
		(TEMP_CONTROL, DISP_CTRL2, MASTER_ACTIVATE)

		(Actual, in driver:)
		This is not done in the driver (values already in NVRAM?)

Step 8:  Transfer image (Suggested:  Commands 0x4e, 0x4f, 0x24, 0x26)
		(RAMXCOUNT, RAMYCOUNT, WRITE_RAM1, WRITE_RAM2)

		(Actual, in driver:)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x4e data = 0x00 	 (set X count)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x4f data = 0x00 0x00 (set Y count)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x44 data = 0x00 0x0f (set X pos)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x45 data = 0x00 0x00 0xf9 0x00 (set Y pos)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x01 data = 0xf9 0x00 0x00	(driver control)

		(Actual, in driver: writeSRAMFramebufferToEPD() routine:)
		(SRAM_CS) command = 0x03 data = 0x00 0x00 (read from addr = 0)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x24 (stream write:  keep EPD_CS low)
		(DC) set high (data mode)
		(SRAM_CS still low) clock entire buffer
		(SRAM_CS and EPD_CS return high)
	
Step 9:  Soft start (Suggested:  Command 0x0c)
		(SOFTSTART)

		(Actual, in driver:)
		Not done.

Step 10: Drive display (Suggested:  Commands 0x22, 0x20)
		(DISP_CTRL2, MASTER_ACTIVATE)

		(Actual, in driver: update() routine)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x22 data = 0xf4
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x20 (no data)
		wait on busy

Step 11: Deep sleep (Suggested:  Command 0x10)
		(DEEP_SLEEP)

		(Actual, in driver: powerDown() routine)
		(EPD_CS) command = 0x10 data = 0x01	(deep sleep)

----------------------------------------------------
NOTE:  Conclusion for the Tamagotchi project is:
(1) The SD card interface under the eInk display is not useful because
    writing an interface to an entire filesystem is way too complicated
    for a Tiny Tapeout project
(2) The project needs nonvolatile memory for image storage, or else the
    image data will quickly exceed the Tiny Tapeout area.
(3) Therefore, use the SRAM + NVRAM PMOD for data storage and image
    storage, and use the eInk display only for the eInk display.
